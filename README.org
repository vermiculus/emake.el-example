#+Title: Emacs-Make -- Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vermiculus/emake.el-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vermiculus/emake.el-example)

This repository serves as a model for others to start using EMake to
kick off tests on a service like Travis CI.

- =.travis.yml= :: This is the Travis CI configuration file.  Refer to
                   its documentation for more information there, but
                   note that we can test on multiple versions of Emacs
                   thanks to =emacs-travis.mk=.
- =Makefile= :: This file handles retrieving the =emacs-travis.mk= and
                =emake.el= scripts as well as calling EMake to perform
                various tasks.  See the file for details.
- =sample.el= :: This is an example project file.
- =test-sample.el= :: This is an example test file using the ERT
     unit testing framework available in Emacs.
